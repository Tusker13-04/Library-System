1,Tale of two cities,Charles Dickens,3.86,fiction,"Profound human love and the most repugnant savagery, horror and redemption, a heroine and a grotesque revenger, two families with dark secrets, two cities, all in the backdrop of the bloodbath that was the French Revelation. In reading it, be prepared for the Best of Times and the Worst of Times. Like all great stories, the brilliance of this tale is its ability to not only intimately draw us into the tangled lives of these characters, battered by the historical tyrannies of their time, but to use their story as a parable to understand the human narrative. Perhaps therefore Dickens believed this book to be his magnum opus; perhaps he felt like it was his clearest statement of what he believed."

5,Romeo and Juliet,William Shakespeare,3.35,romance,"It is well known that Shakespeare borrowed plot ideas liberally from ancient Greek plays. However, with Romeo and Juliet, he broke new ground. Of course, it wasn’t the first tragedy but it was the first to use love as the hero’s fatal flaw. The impact of this has shaped culture immeasurably. It is such a good story. It truly is timeless and has been borrowed and liberally ripped off for centuries since. "

8,IT,Stephen King,4.6,horror,"‘It’ is a book that sticks to your mind as a reader.

10,The fault in our stars,John Green,4.26,romance,"The Fault in Our Stars is a great novel. The characters, dialogues, and themes work perfectly in sync to create a story that draws out emotions from the reader. Because it pays attention to the lives of its characters intricately, the novel makes the reader relate to the story personally. The Fault in Our Stars employed an excellent writing technique that disseminated story plots progressively. The use of compact sentences with a detailed description of events made the story leave an impression of realism on the mind of its reader. John Greens use of simple wording made the story compact."

What manner of man is he? What are his secrets? Who has he killed?"
12,My Man Jeeves,PG Woodhouse,4.07,comedy,"Stories of rich men being nice to their fellow rich friends, or deceiving their rich families, are everywhere. That there is an inherent goodness in Wooster (or his doppelganger, Pepper--Wodehouse switches protagonists & they are pretty identical other than by name, which is indeed part of the theme that all aristocrats are equally dim) may be the takeaway here, in these modern times. Jeeves is the perpetual Everyman, trapped in a world hes too good for, being appreciated & always adulated by the Gods; remaining in that constant position, always in some unworthy persons life (tragically so)."

15,The Bourne Supremacy,Robert Ludlum,4.0,action-thriller,"The Bourne Supremacy is a smooth thriller for grown-ups with lots of chase scenes and action scenes, but the mood is dark, even grim. The dialogue is smart but not smart-alecky. Instead of flashy fights where one dazzling kick to the throat knocks the bad guy out, the battles are messy and breathless and brutal."
16,Ponniyin Selvan,Kalki Krishnamurthy,4.98,drama,"There’s the brilliant storytelling, that makes even this long novel that spans 500 chapters, 2,400 pages, an un-put-downable book. The tense verbal fencing and pithy dialogue that sparkles and shines in every conversation.The never-ending cast with their unique personalities and characters – some noble, others dastardly, some ferocious, others cunning, some foolhardy, others ruthless. And there is the use of so many literary devices that make it an intriguing, gripping read. Cliff-hangers end each chapter. Emotions surge and swell as opponents pit wits and weapons, strategize, and conspire against each other."
